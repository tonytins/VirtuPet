# VirtuPet

VirtuPet is a prototype pet game based on the expired [Tamagotchi patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5966526A/) in a rather unconventional way that I didn't think would work. I took downloaded the patents, extracted them into images, asked ChatGPT to turn the flowchart into pseudocode (see [docs](./docs/README.md)), and from that into Lua. Then I wondered, could I convert the Lua into GDScript? Yes.
